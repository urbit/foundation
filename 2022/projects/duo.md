# dev.urbit.org

**Owner**: `~lagrev-nocfep`
**Timeline** June - July 2022

## Opportunities

- It isn't clear what can be built with Urbit
- While our documentation has gotten much better, it doesn't present a clear
  path to learn how to become an Urbit developer
- Hoon School documentation is old and possible to improve based on learnings
  from running Hoon School Live
  
## Plan

- Rewrite the Hoon School documentation
- Highlight the path to becoming an Urbit developer: learn hoon, learn gall,
  create and distribute an Urbit app
- Create a series of at least three example applications that can be assembled
  in 15 minutes via a high-level guide
- Design a new https://dev.urbit.org site to showcase everything
  developer-centric

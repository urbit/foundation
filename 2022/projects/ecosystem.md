# Ecosystem Showcase

**Owner**: `~battus-datsun`
**Timeline**: April - July 2022

## Opportunities

- Urbit has a thriving ecosystem that the outside world cannot see
- Existence of an ecosystem serves as social proof to the outside developers,
  users, organizations and investors
- Real products, people and communities on Urbit are a better pitch than the
  technology for its own sake

## Plan

- Create pages that allow Urbit apps, ids and groups to be linked to
- Create pages that allow Urbit organizations to be showcased, and solicit
  content from those organizations
- Create an ecosystem section of urbit.org that showcases all of the above
- Integrate the Ecosystem page into the urbit.org primary navigation and landing
  page

# Infrastructure Roadmap

**Owner**: `~tinnus-napbus`
**Timeline**: May - July 2022

## Opportunities

- Urbit's technical authority isn't well-understood. 
- Presenting the technical accomplishments that have been made is an opportunity
  to demonstrate that authority.
- Infrastructure projects take a while to complete, and it isn't clear what's
  being worked on at any given time
- Many critiques of Urbit are in the domain of *why doesn't it account for X?*,
  at which point it's assumed to be an oversight.
- The [plan](https://github.com/urbit/plan) repository has good content, but
  isn't easy to navigate and isn't meant for a public audience
  
## Plan

- Create one-pagers for each historical, current, and future milestones
- Design a timeline view on urbit.org that lays everything out from a high level
  with the ability to dive deeper into any milestone
- Implement said design into urbit.org and make it navigable

## Milestones

- [ ] ~2022.6.24: Content complete
- [ ] ~2022.7.8:  Designs complete
- [ ] ~2022.7.22: Implementation complete and released on urbit.org

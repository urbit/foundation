# Make Urbit a destination for building new organizations

**Owner**: `~poldec-tonteg`

We believe that Urbit can be a great home for people who want to build things
together. We need to find high-leverage ways to bring these groups onto Urbit
and help them thrive.

## Outcomes
- Fund or assisting in funding three new organizations
- Support two organizations in shipping products to the network

## Problems

1. As more organizations are built on the network, coordination costs increase.
   There is an optimal way for each project to contribute to the growth of the
   network. We should help organizations find this optimum.
2. The organizations that we've seen proposed are very heterogenous and the
   options for "founding" an organization keep growing in complexity. Add to
   this that teams have varying amounts of experience and you have a recipe for
   confusion. We can help this by directing teams to resources that clarify best
   practices wherever available.
3. Ideally, the offerings of the Combine should make building on Urbit more
   attractive to outsiders. This only works, however, if there is some awareness
   of the Combine from outside the network. We need to close this awareness gap.

## Plan

### Build and organize the Combine network

An ongoing project is to keep the Combine network healthy and engaged. This
means keeping up with new projects, keeping track of advisors and investors and
making connections to key off-network contacts.

### Plan and execute an off-Mars communication strategy

I will plan and execute a communication strategy whose purpose is to build
awareness of the Combine off the network, with the aim of bringing more
organizations into Urbit.

### Build internal resource library

In the course of talking to teams, I often need to track down answers to their
questions. It would be very helpful if there was a go-to list of articles about
(mundane) subjects such as incorporation, term sheets, taxes, etc. If this is
handy, I can make it available to the general public.

### Plan and execute one investor event

I have a decent number of people who have expressed interest in funding projects
on Urbit. I'd like to make sure that this community is being leveraged
effectively and that they stay engaged. I'll plan and execute an event for this
group.

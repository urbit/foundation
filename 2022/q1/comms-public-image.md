# Develop a strong public image

Develop a clear brand for the Urbit Foundation and share its mission to a
broader audience through cohesive communications, strong community building, and
impactful creative projects.

## Problems

- The Foundation is a neutral steward of the Urbit network that is focused on
  the long term success of the project. As a new organization with both a strong
  internal presence and a public facing role, the UF must convey its mission,
  function, and priorities with a visual identity that is distinct from that of
  Tlon, of the Urbit project, and other companies developing within the
  universe.
- Our role is to mediate, connect, and align incentives across the multiple
  groups working across the universe. This requires clear and consistent
  messaging.
- As the network grows, we aim to attract new talent and increase the visibility
  of Urbit across a broader audience. We also want to maintain a strong filter
  for quality, as it is important to not water down the existing community,
  which is exceptional. Attracting the right kind of people to Urbit will
  require a balanced, tactful approach though targeted, innovative forms of
  outreach that match the Urbit ethos.
- Urbit has found great success in IRL meetups, which have been one of the best
  forms of outreach so far. However, so far the meetups have been only in a few
  areas geographically (California, NY, Texas), with irregular cadence, and poor
  discoverability.

## Plan

- The newsletter will be written and sent out with a regular, monthly cadence.
  Notify new Urbiters of the newsletter so they can join, collect information
  from all major projects within the Urbit universe. The newsletter if
  effective can also be an important tool for coordination, asks, and
  recruiting.
- Developer Calls will also occur on a reliable, regular cadence. They should
  serve as a way of communicating updates and major changes in the network, as
  well as a resource center for connecting developers to projects and key people
  who can help them build.
- We will create a global network of Urbit meetups, with community leaders in
  each major geographical area. Meetups will occur regularly and will be easy to
  find though a directory of worldwide meetups that is always kept up to date.
- Urbit will have a greater external presence. Following the success of
  Assembly, we will put together other types of events, make Assembly a regular
  occurrence, and increase our presence at other web3 events that are deemed
  high quality, such as ETH Denver.
- We will set up the Urbit Artist Residency, where we will distribute address
  space in exchange for the production of new, original artwork inspired by the
  ideals of Urbit or which utilizes Urbitâ€™s tech stack. Urbit already
  organically attracts many artists. The UAR is a tool for outreach, and a
  creative and unconventional way to showcase the creative talents of Urbiters,
  as well as the unique qualities that make Urbit distinct from any other
  project.
- Urbit will continue to increase its presence on web2 social channels,
  following the success of the urbitofficial meme page on Instagram. This is
  another way of sharing our brand to new audiences, and foster a global online
  community but it is important that the messaging is coherence with the Urbit
  ethos, with references and inside jokes that appeal to a niche group, instead
  of aiming for mass appeal.

## Asks

- We're looking for someone to direct our branding and communications efforts.
  Reach out if you know anyone!
- We would like the Urbit residency to have a physical component as well: a
  place where artists can go and make their work in a unique environment for a
  contained period of time. This could be something set up before / after the
  next Assembly, or at the Urbit monastery once it is created. In the meantime,
  if anyone in the Urbit community has ideas or locations to offer, please reach
  out.
- Who would be the right person to represent Urbit at ETH Denver (Feb 11-20)?
  Nominate yourselves or whoever you think is most qualified.

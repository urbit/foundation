# Get the pedagogy right

[Back](/../../#Q1)

**Owner**: `~lagrev-nocfep`

Map out how documentation, courses like Hoon School, tutorials, and other
resources support our goal of producing and supporting high-quality developers.

## Problems

- Urbit is a simple operating system, but it is far more complex than your
  typical software project. 
- It isn't clear where an aspiring Urbit developer should begin their learning
  journey.
- There are many different ways to develop on Urbit, often with very different
  developer journeys.
  
## Diagnosis

- Teaching Urbit effectively requires a carefully-considered plan.
- Different developer profiles and journeys need to be understood and designed
  for.

## Plan

- Develop a master plan for pedagogy. Apply the [Understanding by
  Design](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-Grant-Wiggins/dp/1416600353/)
  planning scheme to dissect the problem and construct the solution framework.

- Run Hoon 101 again later in Q1 2022. *"No lesson plan survives contact with
  the classroom." - `~lagrev-nocfep`*
- Interview Urbit developers. Gain insight into current practices and desiderata
  from existing Urbit developers.

## Status

- Curriculum plan at https://github.com/sigilante/curriculum.
- Hoon School Live ~2022.2 Cohort running Februaryâ€“May 2022

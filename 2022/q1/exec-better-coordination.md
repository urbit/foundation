# Facilitate better coordination across the Universe

[Back](/../../#Q1)

Urbit is now depended upon by many organizations and communities, many of whom
are also stepping up to take more responsibility for Urbit. These entities need
better ways of working together.

## Problems

- Coordination cost is tough. Coordinating people in an organization is
  difficult enough. Now coordinate organizations.
- The second and third order effects of decisions made within organizations are
  becoming harder to reason about and having increased impact.
- The number of organizations that were building on Urbit at EOY in 2020 was
  one: Tlon. At EOY 2021 that number is five, and soon to be seven (that your
  author is aware of). These numbers aren’t big, but the rate of change is and
  it’ll be speeding up.

## Plan

- Software engineers solve complex coordination problems by creating interfaces.
  We’ll look to design and implement them where needed, and work with others to
  do the same.
- Create mechanisms for organizations with increased dependence upon and
  responsibility for Urbit to communicate and work together.
- Work with Tlon to improve technical communications surrounding releases and
  roadmap.
- Explore ways of using the network itself to communicate upgrades to the
  network, and to software distributed over it.

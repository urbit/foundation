# Foster a healthy market for Urbit address space

**Owner**: `~wolref-podlex`

The market for Urbit address space is what enables us to work on Urbit in the
first place, and it needs attention.

## Problems

- There is no real direction or momentum behind WSTR
- The market for WSTR is thin
- The WSTR contracts delegate ownership to ecliptic, which means that the
  contracts are owned by the senate, and they did not consent to this ownership.
  Some galaxy holders do not want this liability.
- The experience of trading Urbit address space is poor: WSTR and AZP aren't
  recognized well throughout the rest of the crypto ecosystem (e.g. CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko,
  Messari, OpenSea).

## Diagnosis

- WSTR needs an entity to own and improve it that wants the responsibility
- All of this makes for poor price discovery of Urbit address space, which is a
  missed opportunity for engagement with the project
- WSTR isn’t integrated in any capacity with the broader crypto ecosystem

## Plan

- Provide better support for Urbit ID as a crypto asset class throughout the
  rest of the crypto ecosystem. 
- Build and fund better analytical tooling for Urbit address space (like the
  network explorer)
- Get Urbit ID and WSTR integrated with the boarder ecosystem.
- Find or become a steward for the WSTR project. It doesn’t seem like the
  galactic senate wants to be responsible for WSTR. The success of WSTR is
  important to the UF, because much of what we do will involve issuing grants to
  contributors in WSTR. Someone needs to own the project, and if we can’t find
  the right entity to step up, we’ll need to become that owner. Many further
  plans are contingent on this step.

# Set the Foundation up for sound governance and administration

[Back](/../../#Q1)

**Owner**: `~wolref-podlex`

There's a lot of operational work to do when setting up a new company, and we
plan to be operationally excellent.

## Problems

- Our governance model (Galaxies oversee Board, Board oversees UF Executive
  Director) is just coming to life with the election of our first Board. We’re
  still figuring out how to work with one another.
- The UF has been operating within Tlon for over a year, and is now a new entity
  inheriting the operational load of an existing one. There’s a lot to get set
  up: legal, accounting, fundraising, tooling, team practices, banking, etc.

## Plan

- Finish the Board selection process. Nominations and voting took place
  throughout December and early January. Votes are in, and the next step is to
  ratify the selection on-chain in a Document Poll.
- Assemble the board. We’ll have our first board meeting as a group, which the
  UF Executive team will organize and plan.
- Engage legal counsel, both general and tax. We’re working internationally and
  are funded by cryptographic assets. Complying with international law isn’t
  simple, so we’re taking it seriously from the beginning.
- Engage an accountant/firm. The books must be done.

## Asks

- Know of anyone that would make for good COO material? This stuff is pretty
  time-consuming.

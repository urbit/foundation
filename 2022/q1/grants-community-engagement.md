# Bootstrap community engagement in grants

**Owners**: `~taller-ravnut` and `~wolref-podlex` 

## Outcomes

- At least eight proposals are submitted and 75% of those are championed
- At least eight bounties are created and claimed
- At least eight apprenticeships are created and claimed

## Problems

1. We donâ€™t have a process for the creation of bounties and apprenticeships.
2. Proposals have low Colony engagement
3. We have little insight into Colony members skills and bandwidth
4. Communication and education around Colony roles is missing
5. New contributors have no insight into what needs to be built

## Plan

**Strengthen the top of the contributor funnel.** The UF will act as a clearing
house to match bounties with workers and mentors with apprentices. This means we
need to have a good handle on who's out there looking for work.

- We'll be proactive about reaching out to active community members in the
  Foundation group, and
- will create systems for collecting contributor leads to match with future
  grant opportunities.

**Provide more direction on what should be built to the contributor community.**
It's not easy for a new contributor to know:

- what kinds of projects are good for the network, 
- that are also likely to succeed given Urbit's present state of development.

The UF can provide better prompts, perhaps in the form of something like an RFP
process, to give contributors inspiration for their proposals.

**Produce better communication.** Document our bounty and apprenticeship
processes, make expectations clear for the various roles, and spend time
gathering feedback from those that are working within grants.

**Solicit bounties and apprenticeships from other organizations in the
Universe.** Bounties have a good track record of producing completed projects
and capable developers. Apprenticeships are a great recruiting mechanism for
organizations and learning opportunity for community members. Enrolling other
organizations in generating bounties and apprenticeships is a win for the
organization, a win for contributors that are looking for work to do, and a
scaling win for the UF.

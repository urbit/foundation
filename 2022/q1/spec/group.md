# Public Foundation Group

The public group can be an asset to us if we put well-organized, useful
information there. At present, not much attention has been put into it.

## Add Readme Notebook

Contains introduction to each other channel.

## Add Directory Notebook

The directory should tell members of the group who works at the UF and what each
of us do, what to reach out to each of us about, and how to contact us.

## Add Newsletters to Broadcasts Notebook

As newsletters are released, also post them to Broadcasts. That's an obviously
pretty easy thing to do.

## Add Grants Guides

- [Get Started](./grants-get-started.md)
- [Proposals](./proposals.md)
- [Bounties](./bounties.md)
- [Apprenticeships](./apprenticeships.md)

## Add RFP Notebook

Contains memos about ideas for projects that we'd like to see get built.

# Vision: December 31st, 2022

By the end of our first year of operations we have created a meaningful amount
of new opportunities for competent people to get involved in building Urbit, and
have cemented the importance of our mission throughout the network.

We accomplished this by substantially improving the developer experience,
granting address space to a wide variety of contributors, and supporting the
formation of over a dozen new organizations.

In more detail:

### We dialed in the developer experience 

In the past, learning to develop on Urbit was confusing and complicated. The
development model for Urbit applications wasn't clearly articulated. Much of the
documentation was out-of-date. While certain pieces of documentation were
well-done and comprehensive, it often wasn't clear where to find them and in what order
to read them. To further compound things, this scattered documentation was
pretty much the only option for learning.

In 2022 we rectified these issues. We created a clear path for getting started with Urbit
development with different skill tracks to progress along, through a variety of plentiful learning methods. Beyond simply learning the stack, the
quality of the development experience itself was improved as well.

Thanks to our efforts on developer experience, the volume and completion rate of
grants improved beyond the levels seen in 2021 and enabled us to hit our
targets. In spite of greatly increased demand for Urbit developers across Tlon,
Uqbar, and the many new upstarts we incubated through The Combine, open positions
remained competitive due to an even greater supply of aspiring Urbit developers.

### We scaled the grants program while improving quality

Grants are the cornerstone of what the Foundation does:

  - they provide a way for contributors to take first steps in applying
    newly-acquired skills
  - provide a reward for time devoted to Urbit, reinforcing the viability of
    putting more time into the project
  - allow a large number of distributed, bottom-up experiments to be run, many
    of which lead either directly or indirectly to larger-scale efforts

2021 was a great year for grants. We established a reasonably high completion
rate of more than 35% as a baseline and saw 31% of those that completed grants
move into full-time Urbit work across a sample of 107 grants issued. While these
results were good, we ended up blowing them out of the water in 2022.

In 2021 we had about two people that actively provided support to grant
recipients, our educational materials were generally pretty poor, and little
effort was spent on promoting the grants program. Apprenticeships were an
experiment that ended up being successful on a small scale, and bounties were
generally underutilized.

In 2022 we managed to double the number of grants issued over the prior year and
increased the completion rate beyond its prior baseline. We accomplished this by
doubling down on the elements that we found to be productive in the year prior:
namely, community-driven mentorship and incentives. With our community of past
grant recipients stewarding each successive wave of new grantees, and our
budding ecosystem of Urbit-focused organizations supplying bounties,
opportunities became plentiful and competitive.

Grants became an even better pipeline into the ecosystem than they had been
previously. We managed to sustain our conversion rate of 33% into a variety of
full-time Urbit positions -- especially given the growth in openings generated
by The Combine (several of which originated from prior grant recipients).

### We supported entrepreneurs that added immense value to the ecosystem

The Combine focuses on an ideal outcome for a contributor: a commitment to
starting a new Urbit-centric venture that will create more value and
opportunities for others in the ecosystem.

In 2022 The Combine made or facilitated over a dozen investments in a wide
variety of different organizations. A year isn't enough time to determine if any
of these organizations will ultimately be successful, but there will be leading
indicators: at least two thirds of new organizations will have launched
products, and another third of them will have completed larger fundraises, thus
securing their ability to continue operations into the future.

Throughout the year, Combine organizations accomplished the following:

- Produced opportunities in the form of bounties, apprenticeships and jobs for
  other members of the Urbit community
- Contributed to core development due to having a technical need driven by their
  product development efforts
- Created new use-cases that attracted new userbases

# Urbit Foundation

> Plans are worthless, but planning is indispensible. - Dwight D. Eisenhower

This repository contains the Urbit Foundation's goals and plans for achieving
them.

We make plans as a team around the start of each quarter that are guided by a
longer-term vision, which is aligned with our [mission](mission.md). 

The contents of this repository are first and foremost for [our team](team.md)
to organize our thinking and ensure that we're all clear on what we're trying to
achieve. We've made the repository public as an experiment: what happens if we
make our efforts known? We think it might result in serendipitous opportunities
and decrease our communication overhead. It's also a great accountability
mechanism. 

Since we're a new organization that's for the "public good" of Urbit's
development, perhaps we should try working in public? 

## 2022

You can read about our [vision for 2022 here](2022/vision.md). The idea is to
depict where we'd like to be at the end of the year, and then use this to work
backwards from.

### Q1

- [Get the pedagogy right](2022/q1/dx-pedagogy.md): The Professor is joining the
  team part-time while he wraps up in the world of academia, and is going to
  spend this quarter in research mode: both theoretical and applied.
- [something something frontend development](TODO): `~tinnus-napbus` has been
  building hands-on tutorials for fullstack Urbit development, and this quarter
  will finish the series with a focus on the frontend.
- [something something agent documentation](TODO): Something something docs app,
  document gall agents.
- [Make Urbit a destination for building new
  organizations](2022/q1/combine-destination.md): We believe that Urbit can be a
  great home for people who want to build things together. We need to find
  high-leverage ways to bring these groups onto Urbit and help them thrive.
- [Bootstrap community engagement in
  grants](2022/q1/grants-community-engagement.md): Getting our contributor
  community more closely involved in the grants program creates a win-win-win
  scenario for contributors, organizations, and the Urbit Foundation.
- [Facilitate better coordination across the
  Universe](2022/q1/exec-better-coordination.md): Urbit is now depended upon by
  many organizations and communities, many of whom are also stepping up to take
  more responsibility for Urbit. These entities need better ways of working
  together.
- [Foster a healthy market for Urbit address
  space](2022/q1/exec-healthy-market.md): The market for Urbit address space is
  what enables us to work on Urbit in the first place, and it needs attention.
- [Set the Foundation up for sound governance and
  administration](2022/q1/exec-sound-operations.md): There's a lot of
  operational work to do when setting up a new company, and we plan to be
  operationally excellent.

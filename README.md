# Urbit Foundation

> Plans are worthless, but planning is indispensible. - Dwight D. Eisenhower

This repository contains the Urbit Foundation's goals and plans for achieving
them.

We make plans as a team around the start of each quarter that are guided by a
longer-term vision, which is aligned with our [mission](mission.md). 

The contents of this repository are first and foremost for [our team](team.md)
to organize our thinking and ensure that we're all clear on what we're trying to
achieve. We've made the repository public as an experiment: what happens if we
make our efforts known? We think it might result in serendipitous opportunities
and decrease our communication overhead. It's also a great accountability
mechanism. 

Since we're a new organization working towards the public good of Urbit and its ongoing
development, perhaps we, too, should try working in public.

## 2022

You can read about our [vision for 2022 here](2022/vision.md). The idea is to
depict where we'd like to be at the end of the year, and then, working backwards, see what projects and efforts can get us to our goals. 

### Q1

- [Get the pedagogy right](2022/q1/dx-pedagogy.md): To get the pedagogy right, a
  comprehensive plan must be made. We'll start by going into research mode: both
  theoretical and applied.
- [Improve the front-end developer experience](2022/q1/dx-frontend.md):
  Developers should be able to learn full-stack Urbit development by completing
  Hoon School, the Gall Guide and a new front-end integration guide. It should
  also be possible for front-end developers to get started without learning any
  Hoon.
- [Facilitate widespread Gall agent documentation](2022/q1/dx-agent-docs.md):
  Gall agents need to be documented, but it's not feasible to centralize all
  agent documentation, much of which is produced by third parties, on the
  urbit.org website.
- [Develop a strong public image](2022/q1/comms-public-image.md): Develop a
  clear brand for the Urbit Foundation and share its mission to a broader
  audience through cohesive communications, strong community building, and
  impactful creative projects.
- [Make Urbit a destination for building new
  organizations](2022/q1/combine-destination.md): We believe that Urbit can be a
  great home for people who want to build things together. We're developing 
  high-leverage ways to bring these groups onto Urbit and help them thrive.
- [Bootstrap community engagement in
  grants](2022/q1/grants-community-engagement.md): Getting our contributor
  community more closely involved in the grants program creates a virtuous cycle for contributors, organizations, and the Urbit Foundation.
- [Facilitate better coordination across the
  Universe](2022/q1/exec-better-coordination.md): Urbit is now depended upon by
  several organizations and communities, many of whom are also stepping up to take
  more responsibility for Urbit. These entities need better ways of working
  together.
- [Foster a healthy market for Urbit address
  space](2022/q1/exec-healthy-market.md): The market for Urbit address space is
  what enables us to work on Urbit in the first place, and it needs attention.
- [Set the Foundation up for sound governance and
  administration](2022/q1/exec-sound-operations.md): There's a lot of
  operational work to do when setting up a new company, and we plan to be
  operationally excellent.

# Mission

The Urbit Foundation's mission is to create a thriving universe of contributors.

Let's break that down:

**Contributors** are people that contribute to building Urbit. We mean this
widely: producing content, hosting a local event, building an Urbit app, and
contributing to the kernel are all examples of meaningful contributions.

The Urbit **Universe** is the community of communities that collaborate to build
Urbit. These communities are on-network groups, companies, DAOs, local meetup
groups, teams of grant workers, and lots in between. 

The Urbit universe is **thriving** when it's expanding in size, quality and
variety at an increasing pace in a self-sustaining capacity.

## Rationale

Tlon has been predominantly focused on building the technology underpinning
Urbit itself. In recent years, they've widened their scope to also build
products on Urbit. Throughout last year, for the first time, an ecosystem
(the *Universe*) of other serious contributors and organizations grew around the
project.

The Urbit Foundation began life in late 2020 as a semi-independent organization,
incubated within Tlon. While the growth of the Urbit Universe is likely due to
many factors, the UF's early efforts throughout 2021 played a not-insignificant
role in turning the Urbit community into a valuable asset for the project.

I believe that at this moment in time, the highest-leverage thing that the UF
can do is steward the right people to the project and get them engaged in
meaningful contributions. With enough energy from smart, wise and motivated
people, we might just be able to reinvent the computing stack.
